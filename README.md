## Hi, I'm Dhanya E 👋

Ph.D. in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) from [IIIT Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/), specializing in  
**Few-Shot Learning**, **Low-Resource Multilingual ASR**, and **Self-Supervised Speech Models**.

My research addresses key challenges in building low-resource ASR systems for Indic languages using  
novel techniques like **Few-Shot Learning**, **Meta-Learning** and **Matching Networks with CTC (MN-CTC)**.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, Bash, MATLAB, C  
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch, Kaldi, ESPnet, NVIDIA NeMo, Fairseq, Hugging Face  
- **Specialties:** End-to-End ASR, Few-Shot Learning, Wav2Vec, Whisper, SSL, MAML  
- **Tools:** Git, Linux, AWS, LaTeX
